Revision history for Perl extension Netscape::Bookmarks.

1.3 Sun May 13 17:23:25 EST 2001
	- changed the Makefile to recurse into the other
	directories.  the supporting modules were not
	installing correctly in 1.2.  identified by
	Heinz Kirchmann <kirchman@dfki.uni-kl.de>

	- updated the POD in each module
	
1.2	Thu Apr  5 01:02:00 EST 2001

0.92  Wed Jan 24 14:47:25 EST 2001
	- minor doc fixes

0.91  Fri Dec 24 23:58:01 1999
	- ALPHA ALPHA ALPHA! interfaces may still change!
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
	- this is the initial release.  the docs need a bit of
	work and there are a few features to add, but this does
	the stuff that i needed to do at the moment.
	- the next thing to do is come up with an internal
	representation that is portable - perhaps XML.  If all
	bookmark formats can be reduced to the same XML, then
	translation should be a cinch :)
	- there is also a URI::Bookmarks module, but it doesn't
	do aliases and separators.
