0.92 - 2001-01-24
	* minor doc fixes

0.91 - 1999-12-24
	* ALPHA ALPHA ALPHA! interfaces may still change!
	* original version; created by h2xs 1.18
	* this is the initial release.  the docs need a bit of
	work and there are a few features to add, but this does
	the stuff that i needed to do at the moment.
	* the next thing to do is come up with an internal
	representation that is portable - perhaps XML.  If all
	bookmark formats can be reduced to the same XML, then
	translation should be a cinch :)
	* there is also a URI::Bookmarks module, but it doesn't
	do aliases and separators.
